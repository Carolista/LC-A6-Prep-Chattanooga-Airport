GA#6 Prep Exercise - Chattanooga Airport Flight Status Board

You are going to create a page with Arrivals and Departures boards that list all the flights scheduled to come and go at the Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport. Users will be able to switch back and forth between the boards and will also be able to filter the lists of flights by airline, flight number, city, or status. You will take advantage of Angular's component-based architecture to set up dynamic functionality on a single-page app. Ready?


GETTING STARTED

Start on GitHub - FORK and then copy the url you need to clone this repo to your local computer. Open a terminal and navigate to the location on your computer where you want your A6-Prep-Chattanooga-Airport folder to be. Make sure the folder you are in does NOT also have a repo. Use git clone, then navigate inside the project folder it created. You should see this README file!

You can stay in the main branch to build your project or use git checkout -b branch-name to create a branch of your own. 

If at any time you get really stuck and need to peek at my solution, use git checkout to switch to the solution branch. If you have changes you aren't ready to stage and commit yet, use git stash to temporarily store them while you switch to solution. Then when you switch back to your branch, use git stash apply to bring back the changes you had made.


CREATE YOUR ANGULAR APP

Open your A6-Prep-Chattanooga-Airport folder in your IDE (e.g., VSCode). From either the terminal you already used or from a terminal inside your IDE, make sure you are in that folder, then use the command ng new flight-status-board to create a new Angular project. In the file tree in VSCode, expand the flight-status-board project folder and then /src and /app. You can now see all the Angular files that make up your application.

Back in your terminal, cd into the flight-status-board project folder. Run the app using ng serve. Go to localhost://4200 in your browser and you'll see the default content for a new angular application. You don't need any of that, so the next step will be to get rid of it.

Look in the folder called starter-code. Copy all the HTML from code-for-index.html and replace everything that is in /src/index.html. Then copy all the CSS from code-for-stylesheet.css and replace everything that is in /src/styles.css.

Move the images folder (which has all the images you need) inside /src/assets. Do the same with the data folder.

!!! Stop and make a commit to your branch using the terminal:
    git status to view files that need to be staged
    git add . to stage both tracked and untracked files 
    git status again, if you want to verify that everything you want has been staged
    git commit -m "generated new Angular project; replaced default code with new starter code; added images and data"


ADD COMPONENTS AND A CLASS

Back in a terminal (perhaps a different one than where you've served your app), use ng g class to create a class called Flight. Declare variables of type string that will mirror all the properties of each object in /assets/data/flights.json. Set up your constructor to take in everything as a parameter except the last two properties (gate and status). Inside the constructor, set the first 6 properties equal to whatever is passed in through the parameters, then set gate and status as empty strings. You will add some methods to this class later.

Back in a terminal again, use ng g c to create a component called board, and then create another called header. Take a look at src/app/app.module.ts. Notice that your components are already registered there because you created them through the CLI and Angular did a lot of the necessary work for you.

Now you should get your new components filled out a little. Delete the default messages out of header.component.html and board.component.html. Replace it with the appropriate code from their respective files in the starter-code folder. Switch over to app.component.html. Place one instance of the header component and two instances of the board component as indicated by the TODOs. 

!!! Stop to stage your new files and make a commit to your branch using the steps outlined above: 
    Write a short but descriptive message about what's been added/changed. 
    Now use git push (or git push -u origin branch-name if not main) to send your first two commits up to your GitHub repo.


FETCH JSON AND STORE FLIGHT OBJECTS IN ARRAYS

Go to the app component TS file. Just below ngOnInit(), add two properties called allArrivals and allDepartures. Give them the type Flight[] and initialize them as empty arrays.

Time to fetch some JSON. Write a function called getFlights() that is typed as void since it will not return any values. Fetch from assets/data/flights.json. Loop through the array of json objects and create a new Flight object that saves all the properties from the json object to their respective property in the Flight object. Remember that the gate and status properties must be set separately since they are not parameters in the constructor. Once all 8 properties have been set, determine if the flight is an arrival or departure (hint: either the origin or the destination will be "Chattanooga") and then push it to either this.allArrivals or this.allDepartures. Go up to ngOnInit() and call getFlights() inside there so that it will happen before the page displays.

SEND DATA FROM APP (PARENT) TO BOARD (CHILD)

In the board component TS file, add a new property called flights and give it the type Flights[]. Initialize it to an empty array. In front of the variable name, add the @Input() decorator so that flights can accept data being passed down from its parent component, app. Create a second property the same way (able to accept input from app), call it type and set it as an empty string. If Input is not already listed with Component and OnInit in the import at the top, add that now. 

In the app component TS file, add two new properties called arrivalText and departureText. Both should be of type string, and you should initialize them to "arrival" and "departure" respectively.

Go to the app component HTML file and look at the app-board elements. Give each attribute directives for the Input variables flights and type. The first board is for arrivals, so set flights to "allArrivals" and set type to "arrivalText". On the second board, set flights to "allDepartures" and set type to "departureText". Now the app component can send information down to the board components, both of which are its children. 

Head over to the board component HTML and create your data rows. Start by copying the structure from the header row, then change all the th tags to be td tags instead. Use *ngFor to loop through all the flights. You can choose anything as your local variable for the looping, but something like "let flight of flights" is pretty straightforward." Now you can use that flight variable to represent each object as it loops through. For each td, use string interpolation to display the property of flight that belongs to the corresponding th above. For City and Time, you'll need to have a little logic. Try this for City: {{type === "arrival" ? flight.origin : flight.destination}} Do something similar with Time. 

Now add classes to some of the td elements. Flight, City, and Status should have the "bold" class. Just like the header cell, Gate should be centered. Now check the page. You should see all the arrivals listed! But the tables are both still visible, one after the other, and we want to see only one at a time. That will be next.

MAKE BOARDS SHOW ONLY ONE AT A TIME

In the app component TS file, create a new property called showArrivals that is a boolean and initialize it to true. In the app HTML file, use the *ngIf structural directive on both board components to make sure only one shows at a time. Before you can test this, you will need to add click events to the tabs above that set showArrivals to true or false. Now try it - the boards should toggle when you click on the Arrivals and Departures tabs.

To make this better for the user, put an attribute directive on each tab div that applies the class tab-active only if that tab's data is showing. (See chapter 30.4 for syntax examples.)

FILTER FLIGHTS USING FORM

In the app component TS file, create two new properties called filteredArrivals and filteredDepartures, each of type Flight[] and initialized as empty arrays. These will be changed to hold subsets each time the user submits a keyword for filtering. That way you can send only those flights to the board components.

Look in the starter code folder for some code for the app TS; follow the intructions to copy the filterFlights() and resetFlights() methods. Once they are in your app TS file and have been un-commented, they are ready to be used. 

Go to the form on the app component HTML file and put a template reference variable called keyword on the input element. Then add click events to the submit and reset buttons, calling the methods you just placed. Be sure to pass in the value of the keyword input for the filterFlights() method. Add a keyup.enter event to the input itself that also calls filterFlights() and passes in the value of the keyword input.

Now your form works, but the data isn't updating on the boards yet. That's because we are still passing allArrivals and allDepartures from app to board. Go to the app-board elements on the app HTML and update the attribute directives for flights to pass filteredArrivals and filteredDepartures instead.

Uh-oh. Now nothing is showing on the page! That's because filteredArrivals and filteredDepartures are initialized to empty arrays when the page loads. We need to fill them with the same Flight-class objects that allArrivals and allDepartures have been given, and we need to do it right after they have received that data inside getFlights(). Go to that function and find the spot just after the json.forEach() loop. On separate lines, add this.filteredArrivals = [...this.allArrivals]; and this.filteredDepartures = [...this.allDepartures]; The spread operator (...) allows all the objects to be copied from one array to the other without creating a reference to where they are stored in memory. 

Now check the page again and play around with filtering by airline, flight number, city, and status.

IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

Go to the starter code and copy over the three methods into your Flight class. 

Then go to the board HTML file. Add a second class to status, on-time. Then use attribute directives to assign the delayed and cancelled classes only when isDelayed() and isCancelled() returns true.

Refactor the airline data so that instead of showing the airline's name, it shows an image. Hint: use the third method you just copied into the Flight class to set the img src. 

Refactor the board HTML header rows for City and Time to be conditional. The header-formerly-known-as-City should say either "Origin" or "Destination" depending on whether the type property is "arrival" or "departure". Use a ternary similar to the way you did in the data rows for these columns. For Time, set them to say "Arrival" and "Departure" depending on the type property. 

That's it! Take a look at the final product. 

!!! Do a final stage, commit, and push. Great work!
